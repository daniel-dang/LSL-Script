The two scripts in this folder will navigate to the web with a media prim
	in OpenSem and view the content on the web. The projector will 
	copy the url from the main media prim and display the same webpage 
	in another media prim. 

Note**: I delete all the url of the Discovery Lab website to keep the privacy for
	Discovery Lab from the general public.
	Drop the script inside of object will not make it work.
