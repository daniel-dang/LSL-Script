/*
Objective:
    - The purpose of this script will only be used to reset the C# script for the List_Operation and the Skill Model.
    The reason for this is that those scripts were written in C# and by simply used llResetScript, only the code that 
    is in LSL code will get to reset. List in LSL will be reset to null however, C# list will not be reset. So if we used
    llResetScript() function, the C# list will have the same information append to the end of the list.
    - When the C# script received the message to reset, there is an API function that will clear the list in C#. More detail on this
    API function look at the Skill Model script or List_Operation
