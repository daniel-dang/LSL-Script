/*
Script Description:
    - The purpose of this script is to prompt the user dialog box to let them choose the filter that they want
    to set for the List_Operation object. This script is main purpose is only to prompt of the dialog box because
    some data type of the dialogbox function cannot be code in C# code. 
    - After the dialogbox is open, the rest of the process will be taking place in another script within the same object.
    And that script is List_Operation script.
