The scripts that are in this folder is the Directory prototype
	that I build for the Discovery Lab. The Directory pull all the information
	from SharePoint and display them on the screen. 
NOTE**: I remove the url to access to SharePoint and my team member database,
	if you download the script and drop in the object, the script will not work
	because there's no url.
	This is because of work privacy and work data that cannot bee reveal to
	the general public.
